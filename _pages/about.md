# Workshop description

Process mining has been successfully applied in analysing and improving processes based on event logs in all kinds of environments. However, the impact of trust and privacy on the technical design as well as the organizational application of process mining has been largely neglected. Both topics are closely related to the responsible application of data science, a topic that has gotten more attention in recent years as data-driven methods start to permeate our society.

Privacy relates to the concern that event logs may contain personal data of both customers and employees and the challenge of protecting the information about individuals while still being useful for process mining (e.g., differential privacy, k-anonymity, homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computing). Often, security aspects (e.g., encryption) are closely connected when processing personal data cannot be avoided. On the other hand, the workshop is about the concept of trust, which is required both from the perspective of trust in organisational and technological measures that event logs are not misused (e.g., for worker surveillance) as well as from the perspective of trust that the results of a process mining analysis faithfully reflect reality (e.g., data quality, traceability, auditibility).

The main objective of the TPPA workshop is to give a forum for the trust and privacy aspects and responsible application of process mining. Privacy and trust are important perspectives on process mining as it gets more widely used in organizations worldwide. We invite researchers and industry to share their research, ideas, experiences, and concerns in this area. The topics of interest for tis workshop, but not limited to, are provided below.
